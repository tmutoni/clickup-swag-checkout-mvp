ClickUp T-Shirt Checkout MVP Prototype: UI/UX & Advanced Form Validation

Description
This project involved the end-to-end design and development of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) prototype for a ClickUp-branded T-shirt checkout flow. The primary objective was to create a validated blueprint for future billing and payment experiences, focusing heavily on user journey optimization, usability, and perception of value.

Key Contributions & Features:

End-to-End User Journey Mapping: Designed and implemented a multi-stage checkout flow, guiding users from product discovery through cart management, shipping information, payment processing, order review, and final confirmation.

System Mapping & Internal Tooling Integration (Mock): Incorporated mock integrations for critical backend processes, including simulated API calls and CRM posts for events like payment errors and cart abandonment, demonstrating an understanding of holistic system interactions.

Interactive Prototyping & Experience Design: Developed a low-fidelity, clickable HTML/CSS/JavaScript prototype, visualizing the user flow and interactions to validate core concepts and basic purchase steps.

Advanced Form Validation & Progressive Error Handling:

Implemented robust client-side validation for all required fields on both shipping and payment forms (e.g., full name, address, city, state, zip code, card number, expiry, CVC, name on card).

Designed and integrated a progressive error messaging system:

1st Attempt: Displays inline, red-text error messages for specific fields, along with a general "Please correct the errors to proceed" banner.

2nd Attempt: Escalates the global message to "Need help? Double-check the highlighted fields."

3rd Attempt (and subsequent): Further escalates to "Still stuck? Chat with support or schedule a call," providing a direct link to a mock support interaction and triggering analytics/CRM events for error escalation.

Dynamic Order Summary: Developed a real-time order summary sidebar that dynamically updates calculations for subtotal, shipping, tax, and total based on product selection and quantity.

Responsive UI/UX Design: Ensured the prototype is fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing and interaction experience across various devices (mobile, tablet, desktop) using modern CSS techniques.

Mock Analytics & CRM Integration: Implemented placeholder functions to simulate tracking user interactions (e.g., CTA clicks, screen views) and CRM posts, demonstrating an awareness of data collection for user behavior analysis and support flagging.

Technologies Used:

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling), JavaScript (Vanilla JS for all interactive logic, DOM manipulation, and form validation).

Tools/Concepts: Git/GitHub for version control, Responsive Design Principles, User Experience (UX) Design, User Interface (UI) Development, Form Validation, Event Handling.

Impact & Learning Outcomes:

This project significantly enhanced my skills in front-end development, particularly in building interactive, data-driven web forms with complex validation logic. It provided valuable experience in translating design concepts into functional prototypes and understanding the importance of progressive disclosure and empathetic error handling in user experience. The mock integration with analytics and CRM systems also deepened my appreciation for how front-end interactions contribute to broader business and support operations.
